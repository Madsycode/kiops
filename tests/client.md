I need you to build a single html webapp that send POST request every second (1000ms) to:  'http://localhost:5000/v1/predict' and print the result in chart that continously updates itself based on the value received. (add an input field to change this if need). The payload of the request should be a single json object with the following format {"input": [1.0, ...]} with 8 elements. The Response is also a single json object with one element as: {"prediction": [1.0, ...]}.
The app muss generate random payload every frame to send the request. add visuals and controls where needed and make the UI look great!
